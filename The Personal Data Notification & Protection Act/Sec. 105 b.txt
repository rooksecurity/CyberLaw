(b) Reasonable delay under subsection (a) shall not exceed 30 days, except as provided in section 101(d) and 102(a) or unless the business entity providing notice can demonstrate to the Commission that additional time is reasonably necessary to determine the scope of the security breach, prevent further disclosures, conduct the risk assessment, restore the reasonable integrity of the data system, and provide notice to an entity designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security to receive reports and information about information security incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities when required. If the Commission determines that additional delay is necessary, the agency may extend the time period for notification for additional periods of up to 30 days each. Any such extension shall be provided in writing.
