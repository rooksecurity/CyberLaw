# CyberLaw

#GITCYBERLAW

While well intended, President Obama released his legislative updates to outdated laws in the WH’s effort to improve the state of cyber security. His efforts are lauded by many, yet in infosec, they have been regarded as leading to “an information security armageddon” and an end of days for our profession.

Infosec professionals are all that stand between good and evil in a world of 1’s and 0’s. We are trusted to protect digital assets around the globe. Poor legislation will negatively impact us, so let’s collaborate and make the updates necessary to better enable our peers to promote privacy, to share intelligence without fear of committing a crime, and support prosecution of cybercriminals. 

The results of this effort will be aggregated and shared with the White House and leadership in Congress.
